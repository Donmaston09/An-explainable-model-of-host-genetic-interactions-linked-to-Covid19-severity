This folder contained scripts used to achieved task nr. 8

1. In task nr. 8, we used the Jupyter notebook script "Unsupervised Machine Learning approach UMAP, PCA, Clustering.ipynb" to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
The variants with non-zero weights from best performing decision-tree models were remapped back into the feature space to form a new feature count matrix covering 100 % 
of the samples (i.e. 841 individuals). 

2. The Jupyter notebook script "Descriptive_Statistics_visualizations_PCA_clustering_grouping.ipynb" was used to visualized via bar-charts, and boxplots, the summary 
descriptive statistics of variant distribution from PCA in each cluster, top-variants from feature importance score (weights) and performance classification metrics 
from stratified 5-folds.

3. The zipped folder "feature_count_matrix_importance_files.rar" contained the feature count matrix covering 100 % of the samples (see task 6) that considered non-zero variants 
from XGBoost models file, top feature importance scores file, and variant distribution in PCA clusters files.
