This folder contained scripts used to achieved task nr. 8

1. In task nr. 8, we used the Jupyter notebook script "Unsupervised Machine Learning approach UMAP, PCA, Clustering.ipynb" to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
The variants with non-zero weights from best performing decision-tree models were remapped back into the feature space to form a new feature count matrix covering 100 % 
of the samples (i.e. 841 individuals).
