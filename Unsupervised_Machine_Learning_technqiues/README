This folder contained scripts used to achieved task nr. 8, 9, and 10. 

1. In task nr. 8, we used the Jupyter notebook script "Unsupervised Machine Learning approach UMAP, PCA, Clustering.ipynb" to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
The variants with non-zero weights from best performing decision-tree models were remapped back into the feature space to form a new feature count matrix covering 100 % 
of the samples (i.e. 841 individuals). 

2. In task nr. 9, we utilized the ReactomeFIViz plugin (Wu et al., 2014) available in Cytoscape (Lotia et al., 2013) and genes affected by variants with non-zero 
feature importances in both patient groups (see task 6). we further visualized bar-chart of pathway enrichment clusters using the python script "plot_bar_pathway_module_adjP_1.py".

3. In task nr. 10, we interrogated the database using the GraphQL query language embedded in a python script "opentargets_graphQL.py". This help us to 
retrieved associations among the variants identified (see task 6) in our study and disease traits or phenotypes through the Open Targets Genetics platform.
