The scripts in this folder focused on task nr. 2 and nr. 3.

1. In task nr. 2, we first run the python script "Variant_screening_training_sets.py" to generate the Log-Odds Ratio (LOR) statistics. This performed 
a case-control association and screened the variants associated with either severe or asymptomatic patients in each of the training sets for 
each of the five folds generated (task nr. 1). We used the python script "FDR_adjustment_of_LOR_p_value.py" for Fisher's exact test, to make further 
corrections on the LOR original p-values. The python script "filter_variant_stat_grading_improved_trainset_5_fold_CV.py" was used to filter significant 
variants (i.e., variants with p-values < 0.05 and LOR > 1 are enriched among severe, while those with LOR < -1 are enriched among asymptomatics). we recycled 
task nr. 2 four-times to account for stratified 2 - 5 folds. 

2. In task nr. 3 for each split, we generated a feature matrix using the python script "Feature_matrix_generation_5_fold_CV.py" for the training set 
by assigning the allele counts of each screened variant for each sample of the training: i.e. 0 for genotype 0/0, 1 for genotypes 1/0 or 0/1, 2 for genotype 1/1. 
The feature matrix for the test set was defined by considering only variants identified as significant after screening the 
training set of the corresponding split and by assigning the allele count of each sample of the test set. We also included as
additional features age, which was normalized, and gender, which was binarized by setting males to 0 and females to 1. Severe 
patients from group “3+4+5” were given the classification label “1”, the asymptomatic patients from group 0 were given the label “0”.

3. Output files from task nr. 2 were saved as "filtered_variants_phenotype_stratified_5_foldCVs.rar"

4a. The python script "genotype_extraction_and_merging_follow_up_cohort_data.py" was used to extract VCF files and merge with relevant CSV files of 24 Chromosomes
in follow-up cohort study of 3000 patients. This unified the WES data into desirable format for variants match extractions identified from 2000 cohort analysis. 

4b. The python script "Feature_matrix_generation_full_supported_variants_follow_up_cohort.py" was used to generate the feature matrix from (4a).
