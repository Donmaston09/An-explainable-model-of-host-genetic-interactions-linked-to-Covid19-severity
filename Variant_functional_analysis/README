This folder contained scripts and files used to achieve task nr. 9, and 10.

2. In task nr. 9, we utilized the ReactomeFIViz plugin (Wu et al., 2014) available in Cytoscape (Lotia et al., 2013) and genes affected by variants with non-zero 
feature importances in both patient groups (see task 6). we further visualized bar-chart of pathway enrichment clusters using the python script "plot_bar_pathway_module_adjP_1.py".

3. In task nr. 10, we interrogated the database using the GraphQL query language embedded in a python script "opentargets_graphQL.py". This help us to 
retrieved associations among the variants identified (see task 6) in our study and disease traits or phenotypes through the Open Targets Genetics platform.
