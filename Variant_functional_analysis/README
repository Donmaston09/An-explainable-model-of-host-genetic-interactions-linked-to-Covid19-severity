This folder contained scripts and files used to achieve sub-tasks nr. 9a, and 9b.

2. In sub-task nr. 9a, we utilized the ReactomeFIViz plugin (Wu et al., 2014) available in Cytoscape (Lotia et al., 2013) and genes affected by variants with non-zero 
feature importances in both patient groups (see task 6). we further visualized bar-chart of pathway enrichment clusters using the python script "plot_bar_pathway_module_adjP_1.py".

3. In sub-task nr. 9b, we interrogated the database using the GraphQL query language embedded in a python script "opentargets_graphQL.py". This help us to 
retrieved associations among the variants identified (see task 6) in our study and disease traits or phenotypes through the Open Targets Genetics platform. 

4. The file "Fold_1U2U3U4U5_multi_col_improved_grading_2000_updated_RF_XGB_stat_whole_LORs.rar" is the panel of non-zero variants generated by considering feature 
importance scores (weights) from decision tree-like models (Random Forest and XGBoost) across the Stratified 5-folds (see tasks nr. 5, and 6). However, the PheWAS association
(sub-task 9b) was done by considering statistics for the variants with non-zero feature importance from XGBoost models only.
